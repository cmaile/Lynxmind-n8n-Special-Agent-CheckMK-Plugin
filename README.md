# Checkmk n8n Special Agent

Checkmk extension package (MKP) that monitors an [n8n](https://n8n.io) instance
through its public REST API and its Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint.

* **Package name:** `n8n`
* **Version:** 2.0.1
* **Requires:** Checkmk 2.5.0 or newer
* **License:** GPL-2.0

## Compatibility

| Checkmk | Package | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.5.0 and newer | 2.0.1 (this branch) | Maintained |
| 2.4.0p15 to 2.4.x | 1.0.1 | Superseded — see [docs/checkmk-2.4.md](docs/checkmk-2.4.md) |

This branch does not load on 2.4: it is built against `cmk.graphing.v1` and
the 2.5 rulesets API. The 2.4 build and its known problems are documented
separately.

## What it monitors

The special agent emits eleven agent sections, from which the following
services are discovered:

| Service | What it reports |
| --- | --- |
| `n8n Health` | `/healthz` reachability and response time |
| `n8n Readiness` | `/healthz/readiness` reachability and response time |
| `n8n API Endpoints` | How many of the 13 collected endpoints answered |
| `n8n System Info` | Platform, agent version, collection timestamp |
| `n8n Heap` | Heap used, heap fill ratio, old/new space sizes |
| `n8n GC` | Share of time spent in garbage collection; lifetime counts and durations by kind |
| `n8n Runtime` | File descriptors, event loop lag, active handles/resources |
| `n8n Workflows` | Totals, active/inactive split, average complexity |
| `n8n Workflow <name>` | One service per workflow: executions, success rate, failures, complexity |
| `n8n Failed Runs` | Failure counts and global success rate over 24h/8h |
| `n8n Users` | Total, active and pending users |
| `n8n Tags` | Number of tags defined |
| `n8n Projects`, `n8n Variables` | Only on n8n editions that expose these endpoints |

78 metrics, 23 graphs and one perfometer are defined.

## Installation

Upload `n8n-2.0.1.mkp` under *Setup → Extension packages*, or from the command
line as the site user:

```bash
mkp add n8n-2.0.1.mkp && mkp enable n8n 2.0.1
```

Then create the host and the rule:

1. Add a host for the n8n instance with the agent tag set to
   **API integrations, no Checkmk agent**.
2. *Setup → Agents → Other integrations → Applications → **n8n Monitor via API***
   (ruleset `special_agents:agent_n8n_monitor`). Set the base URL and an n8n
   API key, and tick the collections you want.
3. Run a service discovery and activate the changes.

### Creating the n8n API key

In n8n: *Settings → n8n API → Create an API key*. The key is sent as the
`X-N8N-API-KEY` header.

## Configuration rulesets

| Ruleset | Service |
| --- | --- |
| `n8n Monitor via API` (special agent) | Which endpoints to collect, URL, credentials, timeout, TLS |
| `n8n Workflows Monitoring` | Total and inactive workflow levels |
| `n8n Workflow Item Monitoring` | Per workflow: success rate, failed executions, 24h levels |
| `n8n Failed Runs` | Failures in 24h, global success rate |
| `n8n API Endpoints` | State to report when an endpoint is unreachable |
| `n8n Heap Monitoring` | Heap used, heap fill ratio, old/new space |
| `n8n Garbage Collection Monitoring` | Time spent in GC, as a share of wall-clock time |
| `n8n Runtime Monitoring` | File descriptors, event loop lag, handles, resources |

Only `n8n Workflow Item Monitoring` takes a service item (the workflow name);
every other ruleset applies per host.

## Notes and known limits

* **Community edition returns 403** for `variables`, `projects`, `credentials`
  and `webhooks`. The FAIL that `n8n API Endpoints` reports for these is
  legitimate, not a bug — untick them in the rule if the noise bothers you.
* **`heap_percent` ships without levels.** It is `heap_used / heap_size_total`,
  that is, how full the heap V8 has *currently allocated* is — not how close
  the process is to its heap limit. V8 keeps that ratio high on purpose, so a
  healthy n8n sits at 80–95% and any default level fires constantly.
  prom-client does not export `nodejs_heap_size_limit_bytes`, so the ratio
  cannot be rebased onto the real ceiling. The absolute `heap_used` is what
  alerts by default.
* **`n8n GC` alerts on a rate, not on the GC duration itself.**
  `nodejs_gc_duration_seconds_sum` is a counter: the GC time accumulated since
  the n8n process started. It only grows, so its absolute value reflects the
  uptime rather than the load. The check compares two consecutive samples and
  alerts on the share of wall-clock time spent in GC in between (5%/10% by
  default). The lifetime sums are still graphed, without levels. The first
  check after a discovery or an n8n restart has nothing to compare against,
  so the service stays pending for one interval.
* **The API key is passed on the command line.** The agent has no password
  store support, so `Secret.unsafe()` is used. The key is therefore visible in
  the process table of the monitoring site.
* **Execution history is filtered by an activation timestamp** stored under the
  site's `var` directory, so statistics start at the moment the plugin was
  first run rather than including pre-existing history.

```

## Building

Run as the site user on a Checkmk 2.5 site:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

It copies the sources into `local/lib/python3/cmk_addons/plugins/`, byte
compiles them, and calls `mkp package` with the version from `VERSION`. The
resulting file lands in `var/check_mk/packages_local/`.

After installing a new version, remove the previous one and restart the core —
the CMC helper processes keep the old Python modules in memory until then:

```bash
mkp disable n8n <old> && mkp remove n8n <old>
cmk -II <host> && cmk -R
```
